# PUBG Movies Cleanup

Make PUBG start faster by removing the annoying loading movies.

This is an automated script that detects the Steam installation folder, identifies the PUBG Movies folder and deletes the loading movies.

Just download and run the PowerShell script or the executable file from here: https://github.com/marsavul/pubg/releases

Enjoy!
